# Accelerated Projection Quality Metrics

When evaluating Dimensionality Reduction (AKA Projection) techniques, a number of quality metrics
are usually employed.

These quality metrics are numeric ways of evaluating a projection, and might be useful to determine
whether a sane projection has been produced by an algorithm (e.g, t-SNE, or UMAP).

In this repository, I aim to provide a comprehensive set of implementations of projection
quality metrics that are fast and use idiomatic TensorFlow in their implementation.
